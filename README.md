# ![Jellyo Music Bot Logo](./JellyoMusicBotLogo.png) JellyoMusicBot (Enhanced JMusicBot Fork)  

> A fork of the original [jagrosh/MusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot), via the intermediate fork [SeVile/MusicBot](https://github.com/SeVile/MusicBot), adding Spotify playback support and Automatic Lyrics support.

## ✨ What’s New In This Fork

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Spotify Support | Powered by `lavasrc` + protocol modules (configure `spotifyid` & `spotifysecret`). |
| Lyrics Integration | Internal lyrics package (no external API key required for core behavior). |

## 🔧 Requirements

* Java 11+ (JRE or JDK)
* (Optional) Docker Engine running locally (for automatic YouTube tokens)
* A Discord Bot Token (create via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download (or build) the shaded JAR: `JMusicBot-<version>-All.jar`.
2. Place it in an empty folder (so generated files stay organized).
3. First run (will generate default config template if missing):

  ```bash
  java -Dnogui=true -jar JMusicBot.jar
  ```

1. Edit `config.txt` with at least: `token`, `owner`, and (optionally) Spotify + YouTube keys.
2. Re-run the bot. Type your prefix + `help` in Discord to explore commands.

### Building From Source

```bash
mvn -q -DskipTests package
```

Artifact will appear under `target/` (use the `*-All.jar` for a self‑contained build).

## ⚙️ Configuration Overview (config.txt)

Most options are embedded in the shipped `reference.conf`; on first run a minimal file is created if needed. Key additions in this fork:

| Key | Purpose | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `spotifyid` / `spotifysecret` | Enable Spotify track/playlist lookup via lavasrc. | Get from a Spotify Developer application. |

## 📝 Lyrics

The fork bundles an internal lyrics module (no separate setup). Use the lyrics command (see in‑bot help) while a track is playing to fetch and display lyrics when available.

## 🔄 Updating

* Replace the existing JAR with a newer release and restart.
* The `scripts/run_jmusicbot.sh` helper can auto‑download the latest upstream release; adapt it if you want it to track this fork instead.

## ❓ Support & Feedback

This fork is maintained on a best‑effort basis. For general JMusicBot usage questions, the original project resources and community still apply.
